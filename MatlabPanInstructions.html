<h1>How to get your MATLAB work done on NeSI's Pan cluster</h1>



<ol>
    <li> Prerequisites: Work through the companion document <a href="https://rawgit.com/dannybaillie/NeSI/master/OtagoPanInstructions.html">OtagoPanInstructions</a> first.

    <li> Type "nano simplefunction.m" and Copy and Paste the following (it makes a random matrix and displays the result of a calculation), write out and exit:
    
<p>
function simplefunction(n)<br>
n = str2double(n);<br>
a = rand(n);<br>
save simpleMatlab a<br>
2^10<br>
</p>


<li> Type "nano simpleMatlab.sl" and Copy and Paste the following (you need to replace "projectIDhere" with your project ID from OtagoPanInstructions), write out and exit:


<p>
#!/bin/bash<br>
#SBATCH -J yourjobName<br>
#SBATCH -A projectIDhere<br>
#SBATCH --time=1:00:00<br>
#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=2048<br>
#SBATCH --output=simpleMatlabout.txt<br>
#SBATCH --error=simpleMatlaberr.txt<br>
module load MATLAB/2015b<br>
srun matlab -nodesktop -nosplash -nodisplay -nojvm -r 'simplefunction 20'<br>
</p>


<li> Submit the Slurm script you created in step 2 by typing: "sbatch simpleMatlab.sl".


<li> When your job is finished, you should find three new files:


<p>
simpleMatlab.mat: a MATLAB file with a 20 by 20 random matrix in it <br>
simpleMatlabout.txt: including the text "1024" from calculating 2^10 <br>
simpleMatlaberr.txt: empty file <br>
</p>


<li> You copy the .mat file to you local machine (see OtagoPanInstructions) or look at it on the build node using:


<p>
ssh build-sb <br>
module load MATLAB/2015b<br>
matlab<br>
load simpleMatlab<br>
disp(a)<br>
</p>


<li> Changing your code to work on Pan


<ol>
    <li> Inputs: The code you want to run will be a MATLAB script or function. If it is a script then it has no direct inputs (perhaps it will load a .mat file, or all parameters will be set in the script). If it is a function then inputs will be received by MATLAB as text strings. If you need numeric inputs, you'll need to use e.g. 'str2double' (as we did in step 1 above). 

<li> Outputs: It is not useful for your function to return explicit outputs: either use the text output (what you normally see on the screen which goes into the file you specify with "#SBATCH --output=") or (much more likely) save results, e.g. to a .mat file (as we did in step 1).
